#Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using LSTM
This project involves building a sentiment analysis model to classify product reviews as either positive or negative. The dataset used includes product names, prices, ratings, reviews, and summaries. The core of the analysis is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model implemented using TensorFlow, which is well-suited for processing and classifying sequential text data.
